> # Modern Enterprise Design for the Industrial Environment

###### PRINCIPLES

## Provide direction over choice
The system should strive to limit choice focusing on the most valuable and important workflows.

## Predictable Interactions create trust
We are the backbone of trust between suppliers and their brands. Predictable and reliable interactions create trust between our users and Nulogy.

## Just enough information; always helpful
Enterprise systems are burdened with overloaded pages. We seek to find the “contextual balance” where information is helpful providing decision support, recommendations and insights.
